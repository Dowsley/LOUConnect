# LOUConnect
## What is L.O.U.Co?
[L.O.U.Co](https://www.portodigital.org/diferenciais/equipamentos/louco), Lab for Connected Urban Objects), is a [Porto Digital](https://www.portodigital.org/home)'s makerspace that aims to experiment with innovative solutions to urban problems, from the Internet of Things (IoT) and digital fabrication, to enable physical objects to feel the environment and communicate, regardless of human intervention.

The space seeks to involve a multidisciplinary profile of people, companies and groups from areas such as computer science, electronics, design, architecture, urbanism, health and related areas in the development of solutions in line with the objectives of LOUCo, reducing the distance between academia, market and society at large in search of a better city.

## What is our project about?
The goal of **LOUConnect** is to create a new system able to bring these people closer to the physical space of L.O.U.Co (into the virtual environment) and to allow an even deeper connection between them. It was born from *Porto Digital's* main university, [CESAR School](https://www.cesar.school/cesar-school/), and currently benefits from all their teachings on Software Development and innovative design, as well as their PBL learning method.

## Where do we study?
CESAR School is first and foremost an innovation school. Trains innovative professionals, able to foster and execute projects that bring relevant changes to society. The training is focused on the interests of the market, both from a technical point of view, as well as skills such as protagonism, leadership, teamwork and self-entrepreneurship. To achieve this goal, CESAR School makes use of the PBL - Problem-Based Learning method of teaching. From real market problems there is the learning of concepts, theories and practices and the development of skills and attitudes.

CESAR School has a great difference compared to other educational institutions: CESAR is part of Porto Digital, one of Brazil's main technology parks and innovation environments, with more than 200 companies, and is connected to hundreds of other entities in Worldwide.
