# LOUConnect
## What is L.O.U.Co?
[L.O.U.Co](https://www.portodigital.org/diferenciais/equipamentos/louco), Lab for Connected Urban Objects), is a [Porto Digital](https://www.portodigital.org/home)'s makerspace that aims to experiment with innovative solutions to urban problems, from the Internet of Things (IoT) and digital fabrication, to enable physical objects to feel the environment and communicate, regardless of human intervention.

The space seeks to involve a multidisciplinary profile of people, companies and groups from areas such as computer science, electronics, design, architecture, urbanism, health and related areas in the development of solutions in line with the objectives of LOUCo, reducing the distance between academia, market and society at large in search of a better city.

## What is our project about?
The goal of **LOUConnect** is to create a new system able to bring these people closer to the physical space of L.O.U.Co (into the virtual environment) and to allow an even deeper connection between them. It was born from within *Porto Digital's* main university, [CESAR School](https://www.cesar.school/cesar-school/), and currently benefits from all their teachings on Software Development and innovative design, as well as their PBL learning method.
